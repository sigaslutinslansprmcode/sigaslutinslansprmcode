Borrowers may need strong credit and income

Reputable lenders check loan applicants’ credit scores and histories, proof of income and debt-to-income ratios (DTI). The best rates go to borrowers with high credit scores, high incomes and little existing debt. Though some lenders offer bad-credit personal loans, a score that’s too low, inconsistent income or a high DTI can prevent you from qualifying.
